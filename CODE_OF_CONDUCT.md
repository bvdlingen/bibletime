  * The word Ahimsa is derived from the Sanskrit root hiṃs, meaning to strike; hiṃsā is injury or harm, while a-hiṃsā, its opposite, is non-harming or nonviolence.
  * The idea of reverence for ahiṃsā exist in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist canonical texts. Parshvanatha preached ahimsa as one of the four vows in 9th century. 
  * No other Indian religion has developed the non-violence doctrine and its implications on everyday life as has Jainism, stretching it to not killing insects and unrooting plants for human consumption.
